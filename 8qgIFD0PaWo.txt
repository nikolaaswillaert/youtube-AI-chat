sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's Matthew McConaughey let's start with love your parents had a Complicated Love Story divorced twice married three times what did you learned about love from your mom and dad and their love story that it's messy that it takes work that it's ugly that no matter how great a mess it is don't go to bed until you've come back together to either Embrace or admit that you truly love each other even if you hadn't solved what the hell you're bitching about that love will win in the end literally three to two with my mom and dad yeah um and that even in the two divorces and in the two times where they couldn't live with each other they still loved each other they just couldn't live with each other at that time for whatever reason they needed and I don't know the details if they needed their space Freedom or what but they were never out of love with each other um and that as a parent if you just if you when we're not sure what to do and you people give you a thousand books and advice as a parent if your kid knows you love them you're in the black that's the main thing it won't work without that um and it can work and will usually can work with that they just know that fact so it's not just love for each other it's the love for the bigger family that ultimately helps you persist through the ups and downs well I mean I don't know how much particularly my mom and dad were staying together at times maybe when they didn't want to because they had children I don't actually think they considered that I I I I think they were much less conscientious than say I am today I think my mom and dad were more like they'll be fine we love them they'll be fine but we'll we'll cross that bridge when we get there right now they would let's work it out between you and I is what I think my mom and dad were saying to each other or or not they uh um they they wanted and needed a relationship that was a tidal wave Rocky right angles tsunamis and to this day in in my life with Camille and I which I don't I like a river has some swerves and some some streams and some Rapids but I'm not looking for a tidal wave my mom's like what's all this everything so smooth yeah stuff come on come on come on come on so she challenges like Vitality because that's what my mom needed to communicate I don't think my dad needed it as much of that uh the the the the the the the the the hard angles that their relationship between my dad needed as much as my mom but the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love yes and that's I've I've always been asked you know when I talk about my parents love relationship I tell the stories that are actually sometimes quite violent and there's some good stories there they're beautiful I think they're beautiful yeah I think they're beautiful too but I've had people go wait a minute that was unhealthy you can't dead and I was like no that's again back to the beginning Love's messy in that what I love about those stories is that's where the love was actually it was tested and it could have broke and been over yeah and it never was again the love won in the kitchen floor or the blood's drawn knifes are pulled ketchup ketchups all over but we make love on the kitchen floor to end yeah I mean come on beautiful so as romantic as it gets right there whoa uh what's the memory from childhood that helped set you on the trajectory of becoming the man you are today standing on the corner with Mr Mayor principle of Saint Phillips school I was in kindergarten I looked up and there was a cloud in the sky and I said Mr Mayor is that cloud as big as the world and he paused for a minute and he goes well yes it is Matthew now my seven-year-old mind I went okay I can see the outlines of it and that must mean it is so far away because if that's as big as the world I remember it took 15 hours to drive from from Longview to Florida last year you know and and I can't even see that far so that cloud must be so far off that is not worth me even considering space dreams anything I was like Army I'm looking down I'm gonna put my head to the ground I'm gonna look right in front of me and deal with what's in front of me because dealing with dreams and what's out there and not on this Earth that gravity holds down not worth considering you never make it it's not even worth imagining it's it's fairy dust so I think I got learned a lot of self-reliance from that I think I I got a work ethic from that I think I got a hey focus on what's right in front of you do the deed take care of what's in front of you one at a time and slowly Notch up your way and hopefully there's some Ascension to that and it wasn't until 40 years later in some ways decades later that I started to go oh I can project I Can Dream why because literally the first time I got in a plane and in 30 seconds I was in a cloud I'm like whoa we must be going a trillion miles an hour because we're already in that cloud that was as big as the world that I saw the edge of and then I grew and learned enough to go well that's not true train planes don't go that fast oh what Mr Mayor said wasn't really true that cloud is not as big as the world and it's not near as far away as I thought but I'm glad he lied to me what do you think about that that tension of a way of living life between being a dreamer and a pragmatist yeah which is a better way Donnie holds the the reciprocity the two of them I mean I can't be present unless I got plans I wanna I wanna have the big picture in mind but I gotta go a day at a time I like to write the headline or have a I think we need to have a North star something to look forward to but we all know that if we're staring at it we're tripping on the way if we're just you know the old you read the Hallmark cards you take irk me you know dream it you can do it I think that's it half-assed horrible thing to tell somebody yeah you know because uh um and you talk and then on the other side you have things like you know people say hope means nothing well yes it does that's the dream you just don't stop there it's not a period after that word now what do we do practically and I think that constant tension when that tension to dance is when it's beautiful there's an asthma but to see those as contradictions I think is where we where it's fallen short so I don't I one on their own if we Silo the two um if you Silo the two I guess the the pragmatics the one to go with because at least you'll get something done but if you only Silo the dream and don't do anything about it that's you're kind of living an illusion and kind of living in a virtual reality Yeah It's Tricky even the people you love can sometimes suffocate the dream can uh make you believe that it's not possible it feels like a lot of parents kind of want you to be safe want you to be stable want you to have a plan so that everything's gonna be okay yeah and the dream feels like a threat to that yeah how much of that though I wonder is is proper initiation because if you throw in dreams out I call it conservative very liberal late let's learn to block and tackle it's learned that work ethic those things those pragmatics first learn the rules of the road the rules of the game the things that we can all kind of rely on this is how the world's supposed to work now it doesn't always work that way you know you teach it teach a child to drive it's like yeah you stay in the lane you go speed limit this is all helpful but that doesn't guarantee that no one else is around the red light but we learn that later um there's an initiation I think that's proper with the dream I mean you I I think parents my parents very much that way the idea of going to chase an acting career or something was what it was it was that was a different vernacular that was like not in our I was taught to work away up a company ladder and nine to five do your job but the day I brought it up and said I want to go to film School and I thought my dad was gonna go you want to do what boy he was like gave me something best advice ever and told me not to half-ass it and said go in between the lines what he heard from me was that made him so happy as a father I believe and makes any parent happy is when our child doesn't ask us permission to go chase a dream oh yeah when they're going I'm bringing it up to you with full respect yeah but I'm doing this with her without you that's when a parent goes ah yes I've done something right enough I made I helped my child be secure enough in the pragmatics to have a foundation enough where they have the courage to go I'm flying The Nest to take the leap you wrote after my dad died I had a dream that left me with a statement less impressed more involved yeah what do those words mean to you we got to be more than just happy to be here I'm big on gratitude but we've got to be more than just thankful to be here or dream it you can do it it's got to be more than just dream it you can do it that's impressed uh the dream is still other than um if I'm here and so impressed talking to you today if I have a reverence to an extent I will not be able to be involved in this conversation I'll be too impressed I'll be anticipating oh what's that question he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna ask oh I think I know he's going this oh I think I know what Andrew he might love to hear oh I I'm not involved in conversation I'm too impressed so I'm removed from the present um for me what that literally meant to me when that came to me in a dream and I carved it in I remember carved it in a tree it took a couple hours I still want to still know where that tree is Santa Monica it was uh um my father had moved on he left this life all of a sudden it hit me oh I don't have the safety net my dad was above law and above religion to me he had me he if ever really if I really was in the [ __ ] if I really needed him I trusted that he had my back above law above anything Allison he's gone I'm going okay it hit me how much I've been pretending to be the young man I was trying to be and not actually put my ass on the line and have enough courage to take risk and actually own up to the man that he was trying to that he was teaching me to be and I remember the world got flat that cloud that Mr Mayor that I saw there was not way up there it was it was fog in front of me now and let's go into it it was I kept I'd say I probably gained even more respect for people and things but I lost a certain amount of reverence that was keeping me from feeling like I deserved or I'd earned things or or looking out for myself or hold myself task um and I remember all the things that I and I was just getting going to Hollywood the time so I was getting Fame was out there as one of those clouds you know with being an actor and all of a sudden celebrity and becoming famous the reverence I had I remember it just it lowered down to eye level and I was able to realize it and go that's not a that's not fairy dust and don't give it so much credit to make it fairy dust like oh I not me no I could never no look that in the eye with full respect but less reverence at the same time equidistant almost equal sublimation a notice where I had been condescending people and things and patronizing and sloughing put things off as like less than me and not worthy of my time it raised up to eye level and so they were all flat in front of me and the world was flat and I was able to shoulders went back my heart rose up my chin lifted up I looked the world looked things in the eye I became probably less sentimental hopefully not to a level that I got callous but I know it became less sentimental um I became more courageous because you know when you have someone pass in your life or maybe it's similar to a situation you're going on in your own life with your Homeland you you sober up on these mendacities that we deal with every day and this this [ __ ] that we that we that we we oh we give too much credits or too much significance to and you're like what am I doing why am I I'm not even gonna let myself emotionally get brought down or over related by this situation because I'm this is it it doesn't really matter in the big scheme and so we we certain things that I I found reverence for and and hesitated from in my life I was now engaging with because I was like oh it's live this live is live let's look at the eye and and go forward through it and deal with the consequences what do you make of death does this scare you I'm not looking forward to it but it does not scare me do you think about it do you visualize it I do I do and it's a beautiful visualization and a beautiful dream when I go as part of the food chain it's not a good visualization when I go as part of a random act of violence in the freaking drive-by or something because the second the act the accident it breaks a story that I believe has already been written at least I don't have the capacity yet to to put it into a a a a a story a Divine story of the lives that we we live and so there's something ugly and gross about it and it happens all the time uh you know to to people all the time I just feel like when it's part of the food chain when I go as part of the food Jam I'm like Ah that's poetry part of the flow of nature you return to Nature yeah there's Grace and poetry in that do you miss your father thank you take a bottom when I think about him I do now when do I think about him thought about him yesterday working through a script I'm working on right now working on scene work and I just had that quick little reaction of wanting to show him hey check to see that's right and then I I don't get sad I go yeah he would have loved he would have loved this where's my mom wants to be on the stage my dad would have been on the front row he's more fun to show stuff too yeah and he would have you know as as what he would we would have he knew he was a character he knew characters I've based parts of all kinds of characters I've played in them and the man that that I am on people that he introduced me too and who he was um he would have loved the creative process of working on a script or talking about hey movie do I always say I love the movie Mud because it's the one that I I visualized and seen my dad come to me so many times as a 12 year old and put his arm around and go hey little buddy you see this movie called Mud God damn it it's a good one let's go watch it that now my dad was never got to see me start a career in film but he was alive five days into the over he overlapped the first five days of me working on my first film days confused now that I think is There's Something Beautiful about that he didn't never ever come to the set we didn't talk about it but he was alive for me to start something that was more than uh uh more than a fad that was something that would become something that I love to do and I do miss not him you know and then I go out of that do I I I we talked about him two nights ago with our with our daughter I was I was rubbing my daughter's feet and my mom is living with this 91 comes in and goes oh look at you just like your pop he was like what he goes oh because my dad loved her rub somebody's feet rub my mom's feet rubbed all of me and my brother's girlfriend's feet when we would have a date yeah they would come over early because they knew they were going to get a foot rub from Jim McConaughey and then we'd come out me and Matilda Brothers on this has been on for decades we come out y'all ready to go buttoned up and they're looking like a hot we ain't going anywhere right now and so we told the story you know to my to my daughter and I was like oh yeah my dad's his hands and miss his hand his hands could heal so you carry him in you I hope so I I I hope so and in it's a uh a challenge for me and I suppose it's like this for any son how much do we hang on to and how much do we let go involve and update the OS and and and and and and try it maybe better or different you know it's that there's certain things that I know that I fully believe in it's like when do we religious when do we Cast Away Our Father you know when do we say no I'm going after the dream I'm not asking your permission I I I question that from time to time for myself because I and it almost feels blasphemic if that's a word sometimes I feel like you can't what are you doing you can't check that and go like well no I'm not sure if I want it really and then I immediately kind of let myself off because I believe where he is he's going go but yeah go you're free man yeah you're not I'm not not the only one I'm not gonna hold you back if you've misread that or I didn't teach you that as well as maybe I wish I could have go you're free you're not gonna lose trust that you're not gonna lose it's in your DNA it's in your lineage young man still it's scary to not have a safety net losing your father is scary in that way you realize this world is just you and some deep fundamental way it's just you yeah you're alone yes but I mean also not having that it's such a gift of Deliverance though as well because it's a I think it's an I mean it's an awesome feeling to know to know we're alone to know we don't have that to know you don't have to take two or take three that it's one take I mean the peripheral vision improves you know the the the the the link and understanding with our past improves because I know for me I was not ever considerate of my past at all because that my dad had that if I needed it he was my will for that well he's gone you know except he had the literally had they have our back well and then when they longer have our back also I'm going like oh maybe I need to look back and start giving some credit to how I got here what I'm doing and where I'm heading it gave me the first time courage to even look over my shoulder because again I didn't have to because I don't have to look dad's got my back no dad's gone from this life he doesn't have your back okay so I mean I don't know me because it's inevitable I I very quickly go to all right in the in the pain the loss and yes even lonelyness which is different from being alone and loss pretty immediately part and parcel with the pain I felt it in the pain you saw the gift the the red light of losing your losing your father pretty immediately less impressed more involved I came like a couple weeks after moving on is there a trick to that to see the gift and the pain that's a good question is is there a trick to it not that I know of I mean I don't I have to I I have to catch myself from trying to intellectualize my way into the reasoning and not skip over real feelings and discomfort I mean I I did get that from my mom and I have to watch it that that so resilient that we just dust ourselves off and get up and go you want to sit in the feeling you want to feel it you want to deeply feel the pain I want to I want to deeply feel it I want to look at the eye and deeply feel it but I don't want to wallow in it yeah um now I was raised where you skipped the deeply feel and let's go and I've said it before but that will lead to having turned into a person who is a repeat offender of the same crimes because you you just get up and you don't you don't have a winter in your life you know what I mean you don't have either there's no introspective time you don't look over your shoulder at the end of the past and so you just get up and you're like all right I've I've stepped in the same pile of whatever 100 times and I'm fine I'll do it 101st doesn't hurt hell it's good luck well hang on a minute maybe we want to stop and go what can I learn from that but it it it it I don't know of a trick I think I think that I think that I think our fifth there's any trick I would say it's just it how quickly can we admit the inevitable I just want to talk about in the book about because I get once you once you know it's inevitable how do we get relative yeah not skip it not throw it to the side not deny it which I'd love to talk about that here sometimes too about the value of denial sometimes the value of denial yeah um but how quickly do we do we once something's inevitable go okay any mind and hard time I'm spending about going no I can't believe that happened no did that really happen anytime we spin it trying to deny that what has already happened that seems to me to be I'm not sure the value of that time so if any if there's any trick I would say once you know something's inevitable even though how painful it is or how awesome it is start getting relative with that and in the relativity is seeing there's a gift here and if I realize that gift I'm honoring now I'm on to building up the beautiful passage of my father leaving this life now I'm on the march to go yes let's let the Legacy let this become omnipresent let him live through me let me become more Hamlet it's transformed yeah so what value is there then to uh denial any oh I think they're valued if you really commit to it laughs I get this from my mother yeah so it's a very pragmatic uh value coming up to the denial okay and and and and and and my mom yeah does it to an extent that that that that I'm like mom do you have any consideration or context of situations and she does this is the thing every time I go she's not a shallow woman but if it is not if it is something if it is something happens in her life that is keeping her from going where she wants to go or having or a joy inner life that she does feel straight ass deny it happened didn't happen no did Mom we're right here I I heard you yeah what you said no didn't you heard something else mom now did she get to manage down that she's 91 hell yes she gets some Amnesty on that um but I've she's not he had a she repeat offend yeah but it's it's misdemeanors you know what I mean I mean it's like we all it's part of that thing when you got a family member you're like yep that's just what they do Just go with it you know and and and it's and it's it's ingenious in a way it's a tool she does I think it is more of a trick with her she wouldn't even so ingrain there it's not a trick it just do it done and and I and I another reason I bring this up it's outside of just my mother is like I did this uh uh road trip course in this Art of Living event a few weeks ago yeah out of hundreds of thousands of chats that came in and responses that came in afterwards it seemed to me that about 80 percent of people's challenges and problems even in their life were something in the past that they were hung up on that they could not seem to get past and it was it was holding them from going where they wanted to in their future and so I thought that was revealing I would have thought I I would have thought that was I don't know going in 40 it was eight it seemed to be 80 percent yeah and then I thought about okay if you're here in the live show and you want to get the course you're into some sort of therapy or education or development or something whatever okay and I have a lot of friends and I know a lot of people that earn weekly and daily therapy and then I know there's a lot of people that are on prescriptions drugs and while the therapy and the right prescription to the right person for the right uh diagnosis is necessary I I'm questioning is there a value to going if you're not getting past this today this week this month this year almost in a decade goes by and you're still hung up and you can't get rid of that thing and your memory where we and you it's got you paralyzed and you're you're a victim of it is there and you're doing the therapy and you're doing the work and you're taking a prescription if that's what you're taking where does your is there a value in going if it's holding you back from going where you want to go maybe you should just deny the [ __ ] thing ever [ __ ] happen Kick It In The Head kick it off the curb I'm done with you I'm sick of you I'm tired of hanging out with you I'm tired of that thing whatever it is hold me back from going where I want to go so if I if I can't wax the car you know and and and get past this thing just kick it that's so powerful so one thing to do like with the loss of your father is to try to transform it to discover the gift in it the gift and the pain but if you can't keep looking keep looking you can't find the gift and the pain just deny it ever happened you could call that a trick but I think it's more than a trick because let me say this my mom after my father died went on and found a second love of her life for seven 19 years they were together CJ karlick love you buddy he's moved on now did she check with us a little bit like is this okay she gave us a little lingering half a second look that we knew that maybe was what she was asking and we came to it was like yes it's okay and you know who else is saying it's okay who's dancing up there for you Dad so was that her denying that the man she was divorced from twice and married two three times and had three children with had moved on no but she didn't say I'm not you know well what's the book on how long I'm supposed to say single before I can be interested in another you know there's not a book on these things how do you feel is loving is is loving CJ mean you love Dad less no is finding a new life and a new dance partner in this life and CJ mean that Dad wasn't your dance partner the dad wasn't the love of your life no so I don't know I mean in there maybe you know maybe there's another word I think it's denial but it's not really denial because it's not like it didn't happen that's a earlier example I was giving a mom she will absolutely go that light's not on Mom the lights on we just that light's not on if I say it's not on sometimes you're just like that makes no sense you just absolutely denying what just happened we even have it recorded and she'll go well the recording's line yeah I mean is that's part of a coping deal with her but I mean what I think is more important or more valuable is to talk about this she didn't deny my dad I didn't but she sure as hell Turn the Page and said I can still start a whole new category a new life a new love let my let my heart love and be loved by someone living in this life today that I'm still living in and that will not trespass on my love for my husband your father Jim McConaughey and I think I I mean we were just thought that's beautiful yes Mom go talk about green like go now if we're hung up going can't have one or the it can't have them both gotta have one or the other now we start to make a contradiction of the two ideas again which Dawn our contradictions get us in trouble all the time man that's life though the contradictions right but is it life if if we just admit the contradictions or so much don't they become a paradox would admit that that's part of it yeah if if contradictions are inevitable they essentially they do become a paradox don't they then where in the Honeywell then we're sinking and dancing and have leniency with ourself while still holding our self to task and it's it's I think it's holding on to no each contradiction oh here it is again so it's a one-off it lives on its own separate from the last one no it doesn't they're connected that's why they are Paradox and then that's I think that's a much I think that's where life really is in the Paradox yes in the dance of it uh I think the metaphor of red yellow green lights is just so simple and so powerful you write about some green lights being engineered and some being mystical which I love the difference of that what's the difference of the engineered green lights and the mystical such a cool word mystical yeah well the engineered ones have reason and the mystical ones have rhyme yeah you know Life's a mystery going forward but it's a science looking back I prepared I've had ideas written headlines and had goals and athlete gets in shape for an event and I get in shape for a role I read I study I work I prepare and I go and I'm prepared and I behave and I do it and I look at I go yes that's what I wanted to do it's engineered green light it's it's it's it's a it's a it's a conscious delayed gratification it's that if I do it today that pragmatic head down believe there's no Cloud out there but then I trust that there is one out there if I do keep my head down to do it I'll get that to that dream we can engineer those have it work ethic prep expertise education and the mystical ones though don't make any sense they're not supposed to make sense they only make sense after right when they happen you backlog and you connect the dots with how they got there that that that that that red light you ran into that made you 30 seconds later to get to the restaurant as you walked in she walked out and he went good morning and she went good morning and yeah too much later you're dating two years later you're married you after that you've got a family and now you're sitting here 40 years later going I love you look at what we've built and you go back and go what if I wouldn't hit that red light those 30 seconds you know made all the difference and so strange that this life is this way yeah and that's just rhyme I mean we can't really add that up yeah it's a science when you look back you you see you know why it was that you were you were upset and ticked off that you had to pick up the kids toys before you left and they were supposed to pick them up and therefore you were late for the thing that made you ran into and you and you ran into the person that was walking in the office that the guy that you did the interview that's the guy you were looking for the job you wanted and you caught him because you were in the elevator with him and that 90 seconds on that elevator what got you that job that led you let you do what you want to do I mean you the significance is there but we have to I think what we also got to watch is again in that balance what do we change because do we've just changed the engineering we miss magic if we just chase the mystical we find ourselves caught up in trying to give meaning to the Lego set that was on the floor that the kids didn't pick up that and what color was it and and why did I walk out that that door and see almost up on the Legos but if I'd gone out the other door I used to go out of I would have gone there I would have got there early and wouldn't run into the the boss and the the so you can start to give too much meaning on that as well I think we can give significance in too many places and all of a sudden I think we've all been there where you're seeing art in every single thing oh man that can be paralyzing it's like it's hard to leave a room if everything's significant you know or if everything's a sign how much of success in life do you think is uh engineered and how much is Mystical I and how much does it differ from person to person because I for me personally maybe I enjoy it maybe I'm genetically built that way but I exist more in the mystical so I don't make plans I travel last summer in Ukraine with no plan I just went there no plan I didn't know how I'm going to meet the president of the country I didn't know anybody and so there's no plan there's no clear thing you're just roaming around and that's how I've existed in life and it there's something about giving yourself over to the flow of nature that I just enjoy it makes life so much fun it's awesome when you can do it did you engineer though I'm going to put myself in the place when you got on the plane to go to the destination that was an engineered choice and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into and I can work up a sit down with so the engineering Choice was putting your shoes on proverbially get you know I always say this the hardest part about going to gyms putting your shoes on right so to getting on the plane that was an engineered thought with the goal in mind but I don't know how I'm going to do it the choice yeah putting the shoes on yeah but there's not a clear it's a fog what happens after the shoe is gone yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's gonna take that leap so I I wonder how much uh for people who are successful in this world in finding what makes them uh truly happy and fulfilled how much of it is engineer how much it is Mystical how much was it for you well I'll say this like an hour at winter right about green lights which is basically the last 40 years of my life I thought that 85 90 of my successes were going to be obviously engineered or I could see the signs it's all the habits here's what I did yep that add up got the solution got the conclusion I was very surprised when I noticed it was probably less than 50 percent and that most of the real successes of my for when I trusted the one I trusted that I didn't have to Define it that I only trusted that I didn't have to go what's the measurement what's the score what this leads to what what's next um and I for me that that's still there's still a challenge for me daily now is to trust and not be because I can be I could I think I can be overly practical and I think I can over over compensate and miss out on Magic because I'm still going wait but do you are we given enough am I are we giving enough the measure and credit to actuality are we are am I giving enough credit to this is this these are the steps to take and and and and and this is reality I I think I'm reminded when I when I trust because that going optimistic just to put yourself on the plane was the engineer for getting there and as you say you've seen you say you roll in that mystical it takes a lot of trust yeah trust in the inevitable Amen on that to but not knowing where it actually ends you it's it's a feeling more than um uh I don't think it's a Clear Vision right it's kind of like a feeling that guides you towards uh towards a place with with uh without a clear name without clear characteristics it just kind of pulls you there where do you get that courage and Trust to go with your gut your your feeling and is there for instance three days later you sit down is there if you did if that if that doesn't happen is there a sense a week two weeks later now when you come back To America that like ah I failed sort of uh looking back to try to analyze what went right when we're wrong that kind of thing uh yeah that engine is always there but I think what pulls me forward in life what makes me really grateful and fulfilled is noticing the thing you mentioned noticing the magic and kind of going towards it sort of just sitting back um both in tragedy and then Triumph so in war there's a lot of tragedy but there's somehow uh one of the things you see in in war this is the first war I've experienced and seen seen the front is the loss that people lose their homes and all this kind of stuff the thing that rises from that is the love for each other so they uh the people I've spoken with don't give a damn about the home don't give a damn about that on farms and the animals they lost don't don't give a damn about um having to move and all this kind of stuff as long as the family's still there as long as the people they love are still there and it's like that's there's this Melancholy smile they have on their face like yeah this world is full of [ __ ] it's full of tragedy but life is [ __ ] awesome and that and you just notice that in in little ways everywhere you just sit back and yeah notice the magic and then I want more of that and just kind of follow along with a little ant yeah keep noticing that kind of thing but uh I don't know I I hope you know what I what I think it is is other people notice that you're the kind of person that notices it uh and they're like I want to hang out with that person he seems all right like he seems one of the uh one of the good ones one of the good hands do you have uh um any certain non-negotiable structure before that freedom to go with the feeling I think so there's a set of principles I'll just uh basically Integrity of being uh good to other people like whatever that means for me there's specific things like I I'm really into loyalty Above the Law right there's a kind of like there's a circle of friends I have and that means everything um there's just a Basics deep kindness towards others uh empathy empathy towards people that other that others might label as um even evil I have that kind of empathy I believe all of us have the capacity to do good and evil so I just kind of see everybody as little babies that grow up in different conditions and so some do evil some do good and then yeah there's there's all kinds of other uh principles I love the dynamic between the different humans and their full diversity I love the the dynamic between the masculine the feminine enjoy it the dance of it yeah yeah so you you have a constitution with which you embark you do too chasing yes I hope so um and if yeah for me I'd like to it's inspiring to hear someone like yourself go I go and I just land and I just go I'm gonna feel it um I can go back and go yeah my greatest truth is I've crossed my greatest successes in my life are when I trusted that and go I took a one-way ticket Amazon Africa yeah and those were spiritual and very pragmatic because they led to dealing with with succeeding in other in other ways that are more pragmatic 100 and gave much more meaning to those things but that's that's to be able to go out and and say that's how you do you have family I really want to get married and have kids but I I'm not married and don't have kids yet okay so actually one of the nice things about that is you can take bigger risks so while I'm not married and don't have kids I feel I owe it to myself to take just to go go to the Amazon that is rather that backpack on and a one-way ticket yeah yeah because that does get harder to do yeah um I missed that um sometimes the the whim a song that comes on you know yeah where's that guy from yeah oh they're from the place that I want to go that I had a dream about I'll go there when we take it what I got to do I'll get a couple shots okay go that that there's that that was that was fun I gotta do this let's get up and go you're free yeah and go when are you back when I when I get there yeah it's a beautiful and beautiful thing maybe never yeah yeah my yeah guys you'll be coming to visit me in this new place maybe yeah how did the Amazon how did the trip there change you what do you remember of it such a magical place I stripped a lot of my past symbols and talismans well I was while I was there what I what I I remember getting there and and and just having so much adrenaline on the anticipation anticipation of getting to the Amazon in the first 10 days I wasn't really enjoying the trip I was just charging to get to the destination to get to the banks of the river that I had a dream about and then it just humbled me I got so fatigued on night whatever 12 and was so sick and tired of the internal dialogue I was having with myself I was not enjoying my company that you know I I I I purged and I remember and then and then and then stripped off identity markers that I had sort of been hanging on to for like everything from you know what it means to be an American my Dad's ring M for McConaughey a meltdown of my mom and dad's class rings from University of Kentucky were gold from her teeth and and and and and his his class ring melted down you know put taking that off was really hard to go I'm casting Am I Casting out my father I wasn't casting them out I was just removing to say I don't have to rely on that being all of my identity so to pull that off to to to strip down and just to where I was just a mammal thank you that next morning I I was light I got present I remember writing something down it's like all that I want is what I can see and what I can see is in front of me that sense of not I wasn't leaning around looking around every corner to get there and as soon as that hit me talk about mystical successes and realities and Truth as soon as that hit me and for the first time in 12 days I didn't care about getting there what was around the corner guess what was around the next game corner the Amazon I mean not around a few Corners the next corner there it was and that was just like a touche you know those times when the prime mover the universe God what we want to name or believe in says ding there you go and that form of Detachment from holding on for dear life to things in past so hard that you're not letting the beauty that's right in front of you the the feel correctly and follow our intuitions to have those not cast them out I didn't burn them I didn't get rid of those things I just took them off and had to recognize you're still here you are you you're much more that is a Talisman that's a symbol that means something to you and that's good don't cast out the meaning but it's not like when the Rings off and the hat's off and the crucifix is off your neck that you're like you're gonna die and I know those are reminders hang on to what they mean for you as we go forward but as we go forward quit worrying about so much about you again I was looking at the proverbial dream the cloud so much that I was tripping over myself to get there and like clockwork Just Amazing Grace boom as soon as it hit me and I was like ah that's it all I want is what I can see and all I can see is in front of me literally looking down at the ground at What was a sea of ten thousand Wild neon blue Amazonian butterflies on the ground as soon as they fluttered up my head came up with them I took a few more steps there's Amazon that's what you came over here for oh howdy those kind of that that truth like that well the Amazon is interesting too because it really has no past or future losing the moment because of how fast it churns it just eats up life it like if a thing dies it just gets swallowed up because uh maybe because of the humidity because of all that because there's so many living creatures that kind of eat each other live on each other so it really exists in the moment and all this kind of diversity of Life there it's such an interesting place talk about food chain yeah you're just part of it there yeah we we humans somehow escaped that food chain but we're still the roots are still there I think we're a bit arrogant to think we've escaped you think I'm being romantic in that in that in that notion well sometimes when you're in a big city when you're in Austin Texas and La you can think like oh there's we're in a car we're in the house we're safe but yeah somehow somehow's nature still a part of us Our Roots are still a part of us I think it is more than we realize more than we give it credit for I actually have it I believe that we are but it's a really arrogant notion to think that we are separate meaning you know people talk about pollution on a larger scale the the climate what have you I think Earth's gonna be just fine yeah we maybe not be here for it but I think we have a bit of arrogant sometime to think that we can Trump Mother Nature I think we have more more of the natural law in us um and I sure hope so if I'm wrong well there's an interesting I've recently been uh there's a guy named Max tegmark at MIT who really worries about nuclear war and he was part of uh constructing a simulation of what happens when a nuclear war happens it's interesting to see that uh you know some very large percentage of humans on Earth uh starve to death because they don't die first from the explosion they die from starvation because uh basically uh dust covers the entire North America and entirety of Europe and so the crops all die all the food sources all die and people suffocate and uh starve to death but you know the lesson you'll learn from that over a period of a few months even though most of the human population of Earth dies Earth finds a way life finds a way to do that he had to adapt and it's gonna be just fine yeah in terms of the big uh living ecosystem that is life on Earth and yeah it's humbling to think about well maybe we're just the stepping stone same thing with we've talked offline about artificial intelligence maybe humans are just a stepping stone to the development of these other super intelligent entities yeah yeah and is it unconsciously in our nature that that's just part of the evolution and adaptation of our species and we'll because we're gonna we were talking about earlier what AI becomes is completely 100 based on Who We Are and we get to see it for some time a mirror to ourselves okay this is what human civilization is like these uh AI systems large language models are trained on human communication and you get to ask it questions you get to have conversations with it you get to realize wow this is what the uh the collective intelligence of the human species our Collective wisdom and knowledge is what it looks like all the bias the hate um the paradoxes all that is in there yeah um the contradictions you can even convince those models you can you can tell them they're lying and they're going to start changing their mind it's interesting to play with them um it's also interesting to consider that maybe they uh they become smarter than us and uh become almost life forms that live among us and maybe one day kind of we merge with them there's all kinds of possible trajectories that we take here how much did that excite you how much of it scares you is it possible to exist in a place where it is both exciting and scary but to exist in that dance mostly I'm really excited because I see human beings as deeply lonely like there's a deep loneliness at all this is how we seek connection that's why we see Connection in others that's why love is so beautiful when we find other people we're connected with and I just think AI can add to that you can add friends that you can have great conversations with and then some of those friends would be AI systems they'll call you out and you're [ __ ] in the most fascinating and interesting of ways and challenge you and help you uh explore ideas together so I'm excited by that is that different and if so how from the internet and Facebooks and these groups and communities that were I think it's fair to say set out to say this all access of information and people will help us find more common denominators than divisive ones um is is it do you see it similar yeah it's similar but further into that direction I think the internet has done an amazing thing in connecting us and expanding our minds and helping us find community that feels like our community and then the communities that are totally different you can learn from them I mean Wikipedia alone one of my favorite websites just oh opens your mind to all kinds of cool stuff yeah it does and not doing the awesome system anymore no and so uh I think AI just open makes that even easier because Wikipedia have to like read and have to do a lot of work uh with an AI system like a large language model you can just shoot the [ __ ] it's more like drinking a beer versus like uh doing homework yeah yeah yeah yeah it's already happening what do you think about that becoming the new family to where you know you said you know marriage you don't have kids could you see a future for yourself whether you have a relationship with AI and that is your family and that's the main that's the primary like even romantic relationship yeah I can see it that one worries me I like to keep it at friends right I think I'm not ready to commit to the moment um it's I wonder how much that now that takes us back to the Amazon in nature how much we still need the human touch yeah and whatever magic there is between two humans which takes the leap into the romantic versus just the intimacy of a good friendship I don't know so correct if I'm wrong you you Cai is having a deep and meaningful friendship yes and hopefully it will be a friend that will help you evolve and be able to love even more and be loved and you can take that into humanity and find another Homo Sapien yes to go yes and thank you AI my great friend for opening me up to this beauty that I have myself I can see in you my fellow human and let's come together and biologically create family if we want to and let's all remain friends with my friend and make your own friends with my friend's friends on AI and let's have these great neighbor it's a good friend that great friend that's a neighbor okay mentor and friend just like uh now there's AI systems that play chess far far far better than humans and we humans still play chess with each other or did they chess is still a game that's fun for us humans right and then we use the AI systems to get better at just to learn to train to discover new ideas but ultimately return to the chess board between two humans uh but of course this world is full of dangerous people and so those same AI systems can be used to um to harm to create false narratives to do social engineering and manipulate the masses in terms of what they believe and all that kind of stuff that's scary yeah well and I I get it when we and I have my own fear and distrust is of AI is based on my own fear and distrust of myself and others there's something it's so very simple but I think it's it's a really fun sort of way to just set up this reality and everyone it's kind of a duh but still needs to be said that AI is a prompt is there it doesn't do anything unless we ask it so what questions yeah are we gonna ask is a question is what we need to ask ourselves because we're going to be looking in the mirror at our digital God that we create from ourselves and just to know that that's that place where it's awesome and scary exciting and scary we go oh it's it's our creation which is awesome at the same time oh [ __ ] but it's it's prompted by our questions and gives us patterns from that which we give it um but that prompting that's uh that's the art of life like we prompt each other in conversation our loved ones when you when you when you go about your day-to-day the next words you say the next word you say to me the question I ask of you that's prompting yeah and it could change everything I could say so many things right now that will completely just the the the the the set of possibilities where both of our Lives can take given on the selection of words I use and you use it is crazy so it makes conversation fun yay and then same thing with AI except the nice thing about AI is it's tireless tireless right let me ask you this if you can falsely condemn me right now and I prove you falsely condemn me I can forgive you and we can March forward stronger than before yes in ai's tirelessness and retention can forgive I mean Can Can it can it go oh oh okay yep sorry about that one that was wrong can it amend yes yeah you could prompt it to ask for forgiveness it'll forgive you like when I toggled around with it and you ask what should I be afraid of you or is there what's the Dooms toward the answer was always well it's up to you she was awesome right there you go again it's up to us and it brought up you know make me synonymous with your human values and ethics and responsibilities but it doesn't deal that I didn't find anyway deal with defining or making choices on its own of what those are yeah I think uh some of that is manually uh those are constraints put on by it by the creators of those large language models basically not letting the systems have an identity of Their Own and some of it is just not engineered in yet but I believe that we'll have systems that have an identity have a belief have a set of opinions like that carry through time and will we go to them like certain states where we agree with the law and disagree with the law on Nations and I'm a member of this AI oh well you're from this AI tribe you all believe this yeah there will be an anarchist set of AIS they'll be the Communists there will be the uh the Nazis there will be the Democrats and the Republicans there will be the people who are on the keto diet and the people that are on this other kind of diet this other kind of lifestyle that just like we have now there's little groups and there'll be AI systems they're going to be supercharged yeah they'll they'll be either the leaders or the foundation on which we build those groups and they'll be it'll be uh the possibility of all the fun we can have is endless of course the danger is always rise up there because I mentioned the Nazis I mentioned the all the dangerous ideas this is the the set of ideas that humans have come up with a lot of them are awesome most of them are awesome I would say but some of them are dangerous the reason they're dangerous is because they become viral there's something exciting in us about those ideas but they also harm others a lot because that's who we are as humans we're uh we're capable of envy and all the dark stuff of hate and all this capable yes we also choose it do you think most people are good yes but I also believe we've got we got the good and evil in all of us and it's which point which which wolf we've eaten you ask people to draw distinction to describe where are you acting and where are you being uh what's the difference what's uh what's the difference between being fake if I may use that word and being real okay yeah the word authentic gets thrown around a lot and you know I I and I don't mean I used to think they used to be feel this way but but Bob Dylan loosened me up on this idea a little bit new thing was all about get to be your only one and only true self that's it everything else is fake and then you hear Bob go well I mean we are what we create ourselves be we are our own Creations which I'm like oh yes yes we are thank you Bob Bobby what I'm all for bullshitters and bullshitting I'm not as big a fan of the liars and lying what's the distinction you talking about the art form of liars Liars fake a Liars faking it but not admitting to themselves that yeah oh yeah it's [ __ ] creation I'm faking it yeah a liar I'm lying to your face right now and I don't give you that hair of a wink out of my ride I let you know hey go with me here yeah I think the value in the bullshitting yeah now the lying becomes Troublesome because one I've duped you and I didn't let you know come on I was just telling the story about catching the fish the fish always gets bigger every year we tell a story come on go away all right yeah but the lying all of a sudden I don't know my own I don't know when I'm emanating something and creating something telling the truth being authentic or lying and I'm [ __ ] all of a sudden I'm leaving crumbs with myself a debt Constitution gets blurry lying to yourself and to others yeah when you start to lie a lot of others enough you start to lie to yourself you don't even know it and that I believe is dangerous territory that's why I'm trying to push this admit because that goes I'm not I'm I'm trying to come in at a kindergarten level because we immediately jump to well I'm gonna judge that boom that's bad that's wrong no no no no hold back on that let's let's go back to base level let's just admit that we all [ __ ] do it Lies We Tell others Lies We Tell ourselves Lies We Believe for convenience sake I do it I'm guilty of it I try to catch myself on it if I can just call it and go you know you're believing that layout of convenience I'm like I know and I even have to do you feel that I'm saying that in the mirror or writing it down or sharing with a friend you know and I go okay well now I've inherently become a bullshitter then because I admitted it that I can shake hands with that's the little slight wink to ourself and someone else to go come on we're just it's a better story This Way in the course road trip you start with step one admit how do you do that how do you how do you kind of step back and through that inventory yeah is there a trick to that oh there's a trick to it I think it's just about courage of having them because it's I don't think any of us like to admit our lives or look deep enough in the go I've relied so much on that lie that it's become my reality yeah and I'm and I and I I don't want to be so puritanical as I say again that's why I say admit instead of Judge but I don't want to be so puritanical as to go and admit it and get rid of it no I'm just saying to admit it just bring it to the surface yeah I'm saying this and I'm doing something different preached this but I actually my actions just admit it just just admit though just admit them and I think that's the first step to where we begin to either forgive ourselves and give ourselves some amnesty and go yeah I'm a human trying to make it through life as best I can I'm gonna let myself slide on that one okay and maybe I've been getting away with it for so long whole family my whole network works well on it okay forget this get to the base of the truth of the matter but just admit it and then where will and then it will also help it'll be easier to then expose to ourselves which ones we go no I'm not letting myself slide on them anymore that is actually a lie I've been believing that's been keeping me from getting more of what I want in life that's actually a lie I've been living that I haven't admitted that is not allowing me to enjoy life as much as I damn well should be deserve to be or have earned to be or just sort of let myself shoot man I had on on it it's not all the hard stuff sometimes it can be a a a a fun thing I'm talking about how many times do we major in our minors let's admit where we sit there and we go all right I give myself a 12-hour work day but I notice I'm spending eight on my hobbies and four on my career well I'm majoring in my minors huh let me admit that there's the math why don't we invert that how about four hours on my hobbies and eight on my career first off just admitting it allows me to go well now I can do the math or rearrange the math by time of day but I I look I just found a hobby tennis first topic I've had in 25 years I had to admit that I that I went to play tennis started to love it for the first month as I feel guilty I was like I'm happy is it okay to have this much fun I'm just having so much fun and I'm getting a great workout yes it's okay congratulations but he found something that is you're finding quite pleasurable for straight pleasure you don't have to forget all this other stuff but yeah but I'm also getting a workout we're getting that too but don't just you don't have to get excuse the pleasure based on oh but it's it's good for you no you damn it the real reason you love is because you're having so much damn fun at it I had to admit that to let myself go damn right I'm going to play tennis again today or tomorrow if it's a simple fun thing so it's not always about the hardcore stuff that we have to go this is a deep dark lie that I've been living by and it's having me live Foster and it's having harmful consequences on my loved ones some of those will probably arise when we admit I think he's just having a look around and it's just saying and when we admit it then we go when we admit a lie then we become something much more valuable a bullshitter yeah you had the little wink in your eye I love the distinction I'm bullshitting myself on that thing yep I'm lying therefore if I call it a line yep well now yep I'm bullshitting eat now she's out didn't judge it but now I'm [ __ ] that I think we can work with well you're an interesting case study because you're one of the most famous one of the most uh charismatic successful humans in the world there's a lot millions of people love you hang on every one of your words that's a hard place to be how do you call yourself how do you admit that you've been living a lie how do you admit yourself in big ways and small ways on lies at this point given how many people love you how famous you are 10 years ago I don't know I I don't know someone was talking about like yeah they really admire this so-and-so person because they're not someone who looks in the mirror and I was like yeah also I was like man I gotta catch myself looking in the mirror a lot and then I go in and I you know look at my my wife's side of her bathroom how many different creams and stuff she has out there look at my side I got a lot more on my side I'm like oh I noticed how if I'm out and public working out maybe doing push-ups maybe I do a few more if there's a group of people walking by that maybe I'd like to impress that I may do a few more than I do if I was on my own I'm like you are vain McConaughey yeah and the knee jerk is oh vanity bad but and also I was like all of a sudden I became a bullshitter once I admitted and then I was like well Bravo vanity yeah let's go vanity let's instead of putting it in the cupboard in the LIE section oh minimum vein because I said that's a debit no admit it and then go what's the value in it look at yeah it actually got in better shape because of my vanity actually I eat better the better in that morning you know I've and that led to being a better better husband better dad doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there writing this work I'm working on but I know that tomorrow early when they leave town they're gonna remember this time that we had together that's a selfish act to go spend that time with my kids or my even though I'd rather not be doing it at that time I'd rather I'd be doing something for myself because when they leave tomorrow they've got they'll have this great memory that they spent with their dad right before they went that that I could call that vanity I could group that and say that's very vain of you that was for self yeah because it was also for some and someone that I cared about other people in your life that uh call you on your [ __ ] in the uh bad sense of the word [ __ ] yeah yeah sometimes it's either I got a pretty thick threshold for how far I can go with my [ __ ] like what bruise what tickles me might bruise others to watch it that's a good line yeah um tickles me my bruise others but I also I go back and talk about the [ __ ] that's over there with those mystical successes it's the yeah no no go with it don't pull a parachute yet let's see how far we can go let's see how hot it can get let's try it one more time yes two more please that's where a lot of great pleasure and stories and successes will come from those are mystical they don't add up it's like we're not talking about reason right now we're not talking logic just go with this let's talk about the virtual and making it real the old line of fake it till you make it I mean what is that there's something to that there's definitely something to it but I would you know where people go fake it as I would go back to Dillinger and create it yeah recreate it create and recreate it you know until you till it becomes till you make it um so I'll have people call my [ __ ] and a lot of times you're right I think when I handled the most healthy way is I admit yes and I'm aware so I'm and I'm going to keep going so you're not like resisting you're denying it oh I will I will and I have to watch that where I'm like no I'm not that's not what I'm doing and and usually when it's coming from people there they're going no you are it took I won't admit it and then that's where I'm telling a lie and that'll come up get me later and I'll go I didn't see it I didn't see I was doing that I was either unaware I wouldn't let myself be aware I was denying that I was doing that would you say that's ego has ego been bad or good for you oh gosh I think it's been think I'm so thankful for ego um dude does it get off the Bridle for me sometimes and run loose and run places and where it's not of service to others and as it hurt loved ones and even strangers yes um but I I also when my ego is really strong it's it's in sync with serving it's in sync with where I serve myself also serve as others serves others it's those two are part and parcel they're they're they're they're intertwined and that's the capital E ego that I think I think could hope we all need more of and that's what I mean when I talk about selfish that's to really redefine that was the real true meaning of that is not doing something for self at expense of your neighbor or harming others it's for personal profit and pleasure that also is profit and pleasure for a utilitarian sends more of others and there's a there's again back to the Paradox today I think there's a place I know there's a place I believe there's a place where those are in sync and when my ego's healthy um I'm able to say I'm sorry sooner for a lie or a misdemeanor or harm somebody I'm able to be more empathetic because I got the confidence yeah to be so I'm able to be more humble but still have my chin high and my heart high and look in the eye and go yep my bad bogey guilty I shank that one out of bounds man that's beautiful so ego can be constructive not destructive you want an Oscar for your performance in Dallas Buyers Club can you tell the story of becoming that character Ron Woodruff what was the toughest part toughest part which was the most enlightening part was getting to know who he was in between the lines we're based on a life story in an hour and a half of film and script is great but who was he in between the lines who was he before he started a business before he was on a crusade before you went to alternative medicines and you know the the the the obvious thing people always talk about well how did you lose all that weight that was not hard that was just to militaristic decision this is what I can eat each day and if I do this each day for a week I'll lose 2.5 pounds in a week so I'm gonna give myself five months to do that 2.5 times as 10 years ago there's 47 pounds that was like clockwork so that was easy that decision was made I didn't go to Pizza Hut buffet and have Temptation in front of me had certain meals I ate that when the weight just went off like clockwork it was the who is Ron would have been between the lines and what the gift I got given that gave me the insight to who that man was this I went to see his family and his uh before I was as I was leaving his family offered me his diary and I remember it kind of has it going wow yes but I kind of hesitated because it felt maybe a little too intimate of a thing for me to have I felt like it was kind of maybe infringing a bit but I opened my hand and took it and what I got in the diary was I've got to know who Ron was before he had HIV and little thing the diary he'd write in and in the the the the dreamer he was and the getting all set on a Sunday night and laying his shirt out and ironing it for the next morning making sure there's a little pager had fresh batteries in it because tomorrow morning he was going across town to hook up some speakers for 38 bucks or whatever and then getting up that morning and writing about what kind of coffee he drank and how much gas it was going to take to get over across town to do that job and hook up those beakers and then on the way over Paige coming in to say no we don't need you we've gone with somebody else to hook them up and here he was all buttoned up two cups of coffee in hair slicked over shirt ironed a little less than half a tank of gas but enough to get back home Now where's this Monday go The Hope and the disappointment you have to take all that in that's part of that man I'm gonna I'm just gonna go to Sonic and get double cheese bacon burger because Sheila over there man she's kind of cute she always gives me half price on it yeah which leads to rolling the joint hanging off till Sheila gets off to work sneaking over the local motel and shagging up in room 16. that's my lucky number 16. she laughed yeah been wandering out that night getting home one in the morning no plans for Tuesday and maybe later in the week think about what am I gonna do about work or job and these little dreams would get me Peak and want to and then something would happen where he wouldn't follow through or the deal would go down the deal would go south that no one who that that there's in there was where I saw who he was a dreamer and then and and and he just couldn't catch the break and didn't follow through and then I remembered his family said like oh yeah he he invented he got patents on a whole bunch of things but he never would he had things to get patent but never would follow through to get the government patent and then later on you'd see the product be made or sold on QVC or something they'd be like Ron that was yours or they stole your idea did you patent that he'd be like no like never would that there's something beautiful and sad about that yeah that led me inside who he was in his heart and um who he wanted to be and when he was hoping to be and trying to be but couldn't quite pull off when you go that deep this there's a part of him stay in you forever are you able to let go I I mean I hope so I get I look there's a tenacity to to to survive that I got from him look hopefully I can try and find some of that in different ways in any character that I go play because that's if you if you really want to give a character an obstacle to overcome a need I mean the base one is life and death whether that's the need to survive or the need to Stave off Extinction I'm not talking about what the rules the laws are the social mores the manners and Graces I'm fighting you're going to fight for your own life in a world that's not supporting you to do so you there's a wonderful courage of [ __ ] it watch this what do I got to lose my life or I'm in charge of extending it get out of the way and I'll pick your pocket along whatever it takes so there's a tenacity to live by whatever means necessary to survive that I that I that I'm reminded of that I learned from raw so on that line of survival between life and death you starred in uh True Detective which I think um explores some darker aspects of human nature what did you take from that from that role that experience philosophically psychologically the freedom of of being on an island he was such a singular character and of a singular mind and as you know it wasn't a dance party up there in his mind it was it was some some heavy stuff but also existentially for him always like death would be a Deliverance for him it'd also be a cop-out in a way it'd also be he was not not a man who was going to give himself amnesty and didn't allow it from the rest of the world it wouldn't give himself an out and while living in his head and heart and spirit was more of a hell than arguably dying it was not no alternative that's not negotiable for that man and that's why he was such a that's why he was the best detective that ever walk the earth that's why he was such a superhero in a way to have that singular you don't go oh I wish I was him no but you're like wow that Constitution that Clarity of identity talk about a measure in a man's Constitution he didn't allow anybody off the hook especially himself you wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself a little Amity he wanted him to like man it's Saturday bro can you go on a date he wanted him to like enjoy something but he was connected to something in his DNA who's who he was doing something much more Baseline truth and that's why he was such a good detective so that but there's an island as much as that company can be I said earlier on that Amazon chip but it wouldn't join the company there's Parts I think that I maybe gave to myself to rusting coal and also that rusting curl has given back to me that I like yeah when you're when you want to pull the parachute because you can't stand the company that you're in McConaughey in your own mind the socratic dialogue is driving you freaking crazy don't pull a parachute stick with it go through it so you were able to walk around with that tormented mind of his tormented I did I I didn't have very much patience for mendacious talk I didn't have as much patience for small talk I wasn't tormented but the character was and you have to embody him so is that I mean does some of that bleed over are you able to uh separate the man you are from the character it's not look am I able to separate yeah I came home to my kids and when they walk in the door and greet me and go what'd you do today and you got three kids under 10 years old you don't tell them about the scene where you help someone commit suicide it's just you know so you you turn it into a parable it actually I've always said this having kids have made me a better actor and a better Storyteller because I have to parabolize certain things you know um and tell it in ways as I go oh neat you know um so I did did I go did I bring it home I didn't bring torment did I bring introspection into my own this character's for me and I think this is true for a lot of actors and actresses we don't it's not a separation if I've got I we each have everyone else in US it's just seeing diving into rust and gold knowing where his mind and heart is from the hand of Nick pizzolato who wrote the character and wrote the whole series understanding number one what the hell am I saying what's he talking about then going deeper into that well if that this person really believes that what does that say about how they move then I'm going all of a sudden well who was that in me what part of my left brain is locked into that what part of my Reptilian Brain is latched on to that wherever this other stuff is non-negotiable then I just live in that and it's I always taught like a 70s equalizer remember the old that morons equalizers you can you move up your 500 hkz move up your 60 you you just re you re Ria uh rebalanced equalizer and we all have so it's just going to those parts of me where I'll turn up the volume some parts of the base the treble on The Equalizer and turn down other parts of myself and I'll I'm not coming home tormented as rust and Cole am I coming home seeing torment where it should be seen am I reading the news differently or things coming out of the news and catching my eye as being [ __ ] or lies or truth that is just hard and going yep yeah I'm seeing it through a different lens but I'm seeing my own life through a different lens a lens that was opened up and an aperture that was opened up through rust and Cole I mean the the the process of being an actor an actress I guess is a really interesting way to be a philosopher of human nature yeah I mean it's an incredible really in it dive into the humanities yeah and all the ologies yeah and philosophy and as I said I going to going to as I opened up the question like that the vague the being on an island is a vacation I am also conscious for five months when I'm playing rusting coal that this this is an interesting fact I've I've never I was as strong spiritually with my relationship with God when I did True Detective as I've ever been why is that okay which you would say wait a minute in some ways that's a those are antonyms they do worry no but but my I I pretty sure pretty safely can say that my own strength of spirit in my own personal life Matthew's life there gave me the confidence to go further away deeper into the torture and deeper into the but it was still he was still always going after truth that was the thing he was not he was not not an evil man I don't even know if you can call him a non-believer but he was always going after the truth and the truth burned and he would take the scar and get burned for it he'd die for it that something was actually from biblical about that you know and and so but I've been I I don't think it's coincidence that I was had so much of diving into the depths of that uh tortured character because I trusted that when I go out I'll come up the other side it's always like jumping in a pool of water and can you trust you'll come up the other side and not you know you go play a criminal you you trust you're not gonna come out the other side of tyrant in real life you just go ah God I got to go do that came out and I'm still alive got all my faculties I'm not in jail whatever it is and so my own spirituality that time yeah definitely I think gave me a certain trust and confidence to go further into the dark it was announced that you'll be starring in a Yellowstone spin-off show what do you think about the uh Cowboy ethos the permeates Yellowstone and other shows created by Taylor Sheridan you're a Texan I'm a Texan yeah what do you think about that like philosophy and way of life all right I admire the Simplicity of it I mean one bit one way you could explain Yellowstone and a costume's roles what will um what will man do to protect land and family in a world that's trying to encroach in a world where there's a Cabo ethos that deems trespassing more clear earlier yeah but then then other other hats um I admire that simplicity of right and wrong and that the the Simplicity of that right and wrong doesn't always uh correlate coincide with the law nope it's above the law it's you mentioned something earlier I remember where it was in conversation but a little bit of like okay if the law I ain't handling this I am yeah and then it is um the Law's not going to handle this therefore I am and then it is I'm handling this law talk to them when you get to them I'm handling this there's a honesty to that it just seems of course it's dangerous because uh it's a slippery slope uh that because of the power in that power corrupts it can be a slippery slope or you completely disregard the law and you can hurt a lot of people but when done right you know there feels to be a something really uh authentic and human about that protect family protect land Above All Else look I you know this is a broader question but I'm going to piggyback it off this back to the dreams and reality and then evolved species and how what can we do in creating a digital God and Ai and these communities and friends that challenge us and think like us we like to hang out with our do you think we're less evolved species than we give ourselves credit for do you think we give ourselves credit for being more involved than we actually are I think we do I do I think we need to admit that I think probably the cowboy ethos is a is a stepping towards admitting that and that's why it's so appealing to people it kind of wakes them up to realize that we are uh we're not so far from our ancestors that uh the values of loyalty are really important um Trust on the basic human level how do you know if you can trust someone I don't know if I can trust someone well I don't know a trick to it I do not know a trick to it but I do come in as I believe you do with high Trust I come in with a um I'm told sometimes I think I'm I'm told that I trust too much sometimes have you been hurt have you been betrayed um and if you have has that like hurt your willingness to trust no it hurt and I put that person and those people in another category back here and do my best not to let them know that it bothered me at all but I know when I'm with those people but a new person you're still alive no I'm not going to do that I think that's that's the beginning of cynicism which I think is a horrible disease of getting older I'm not going to do that you're fighting cynicism off as much as you can okay no way no way no way I mean there's no there's no there's no residual in it yeah there's no wind yeah yeah um it's easy it's clever gets the laugh at the party but uh and and if it sleeps well it shouldn't be don't get comfortable in the cynicism I I have to ask you about being a Texan you're like when I think Texas I think man Matthew McConaughey uh what's it mean to be a Texan to you I recently moved to Austin Texas some uh two years in all right all right welcome what's it mean to be a tax educators Texas is about independence politically Texas is not about Republican or Democrat it's about independence independence of spirit sovereignty uh Texas is about exploration one of the things I love about Texas is I run into so many Texans around the world Texans are taught to go b-tech conservative learn your learn learn who we are then go go explore Pioneer Journey and hopefully you come on back with some goods and some stories are you texting and underneath that is this kind of freedom of being an individual in the in the full meaning of that word yeah well Texas is liberal on your entrance very liberal on your entrance less regulation hey welcome High trust High trust sir Welcome to our state come on in yes yes yes but if you like cheats deal yeah we're conservative on our consequences ah damn that's a good line um you've uh briefly pondered running for governor I don't know if that's in your future I hope it is uh you had a few good lines about it do you think about that kind of stuff about what the future holds in terms of uh political office I don't think about it in terms of political office I've I've graduated to a broader larger thought of what's my future hold and and where and would I be most useful as a leader I think that's a fair word whether that's thought whether that's leader of my family right now it's a parent his father um the leader of people that work with me um politics is it's I'm not going to say it's it's because it's not it's not small and I'm not I don't I don't that's that's why I say that out loud it's not small I do think it needs to re-engineer and re-define what its purpose is before because it's just chasing its own tail right now with the with the with the with the two parties uh that are seem to me to be completely about just invalidation of the opposition instead of vision of themselves um so I think it needs redefinition of what it is because it is important that's what I mean that's why I said I don't mean small it's it's it needs to think bigger about what it is and how it's useful when it seeks to invalidate it's small when it seeks vision it can be big yes well one's affirmative one's going into that cynicism we were talking about yeah you know and validation of any opposing thought or maybe that we're even opposing opposition is a is a is a is an is an arrogant term that's too strong it's a lot of times it's not even opposition alternative other than another way of thinking about it oh could both be true oh how can we parlay those two ideas um you know this the the the one of the challenges with these ideas of a third party or Mitch in the middle it's kind of got this historic notion of being oh well it's sort of Mr in between kind of go which way the wind blows I think done in the right way it's the and it doesn't have to be under a third party's name necessarily but it's actually an incredibly rebellious position right now and it's actually and I love sports it's tactically the place with which to move most advantageously I think of the free safety in the game of football they're in the middle of the field and they're deep they choose to defend left or right according to the play that's been called by the offense similar to the offense the running back you read the divas and then you're going to run right to run left to go away from that opposition it's it's a tactical spot to be truly independent and respond and respond so do you think you have a role in that in political officers I don't know I it don't it's on mine it's not out of my mental mental box um and I gave it real sincere thought and discernment for over a year and it's a wonderful whether whether I end up whether I end up in politics or not it was a wonderful exercise one that if anyone else got time to do it do it to ask yourself what you would do if you were a CEO yeah of the state CEO the nation CEO or the world that's a great thing to go you want to get your values line you want to admit where you lie and throw yourself some pop quizzes and what if this phone call comes at 4am what you gonna you know who you wanna surround yourself with it's really great questions to ask and I think has helped me at a more micro level be a better father a better man taking considerations that I did not maybe take in as seriously before considering it um I don't know if that's in my future I got you know useful is a big word it's got to be I would have to be useful I have to be useful in the right way and is that my Lane to be most useful it's a good question for a leader to ask how can it be useful I have to ask you about Interstellar so I think it's an incredible film I've seen it Inspire so many scientists and Engineers it's just uh philosopher everybody humans it explores space travel physics of space time human nature Human Condition human connection um how is that film expanded your understanding of uh the the universe and our place in it yeah well it's the uh it's got the old Mr Mayor on the corner how big is that cloud metaphor in it because that was the character I played Cooper's that was the existential question for him head down practical stay here be a father to my children but his dream before his children or to go explore space so when he's taking that truck out and the countdown's going down that's the the hinge of the existential question that we all face in some form um the the the the sense of time I wish I think everyone loves that sense of where time can run at different speeds and I there's a incredible scene where Cooper is a father's getting video feed from his children who aged and he's realizing he's missed all that that it it you know I mean overall that that concept makes me consider and imagine I'm gonna talk about mystical successes instead of engineered ones like the engineered ones that there's there's eat those from that film and and what Nolan put into that film and theories that make me go yeah what does it do this matter what do we maybe we are maybe we're it makes me go maybe this is all it's already all been it's already all been written what's happening right now in this flip of time you're here 53 years so far we'll see how many we get um what other parallel timelines are happening out there do is it is it small-minded of us to Define life on other planets as only something that can live within a climate that has water in this amount of o2 those terms may be um too too small thing what do you mean who are we saying only life has to have water in this amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide I don't know maybe that's maybe there's a whole redefinition of the ingredients that other life forms need um it's sure in a similar way to contact this is a movie I did with Bob zimekus um yeah inspires me that the universe is more active and Lively in God's backyard's bigger than I thought and wow that's exciting and you know people go now you believe in extra life I said yes man I think it'd be arrogant not to I sure hope so you think there's alien civilizations all out there intelligent ones just far in far on the distant Stars I I hope so and I think we it's possible may have many Among Us right here one and I go for the the why not in that just to keep that that train of thought open to the to learn and and and and and consider you know those existential questions I think be arrogant not to there's so many hundreds of billions of planets just in our galaxy just in ours I can't imagine there's not life out there and um but I suspect it's very different like you said than we are and we have to have a humility to open our eyes to how different life could be and if and when we cross it unlike we've had a tendency to do when we try to go with some Nation takeovers um I think it would be R inherent glitch to go in believing that any other life-form civilization wants to take over territories to go into it with thinking that okay this is an opposition I mean I I think that's a human trait of ours and to consider that another life form would have an interest that more land or more territory is good for them I think I think it's a shallow idea I don't think they're I think of it more like you know when I think of Heaven those considerations are not in in anyone's mind heart or intent in the heaven that I think of you know so in other civilization these things I don't I mean I I hope that if we would just see and learn that would be the natural side of welcoming it wouldn't be a primate response to no I have fire and you're coming over trying to put it out or I have food and you're trying to steal my food I don't know how to I don't think it would be I think it's a shallow thought to think that oh it's going to be about ownership and we would be trespassing I think it would be I don't think they're would have a sense of borders as we do I just hope we humans are smart enough to detect and to see aliens because because of how different they are you know we don't we often have a very narrow definition of what is intelligence you know it's very possible that trees are extremely intelligent if we kind of zoom out at a different time scale or different like just look at stuff in a from a bigger perspective that that's outside of being so human-centric it's great quote that someone told me this astrophysicist told me this how accurate is or not someone else can argue the validity of what I'm about to say or not but I thought it really was a prospective grabber for me like look see the universe was created at midnight humans came around at 11 59 and 36 seconds I love little now these are that put that frame like they make oh yeah the pale blue dot there it is that perspective something so relaxing and empowering about that at the same time and humbling but confidence boosting yeah you know allows forgiveness allows ambition um I just love the perspective of that that picture to picture it that way in our timeline do you hope humans become a multiplayer species as we're trying to do as a SpaceX is pushing forward trialing out to Mars potentially colonizing Mars colonizing other planets yeah I'm you yeah go explore I love the ambition of it I love the uh um pioneering nature I love the extension of what we consider as our backyard becoming more four-dimensional like that not at the expense of we still got stuff to take care of we've got Gardens to tend right here and sure as hell not to go not to quit on us to go oh let's get out of here because this isn't really working no no no no no no no we got a tithe we're still supposed to pay here we don't that's part of this pressure testing us as a civilization of the species whether you call that restoration order or whether you call that let's figure out how to adapt best we can uh no not at the expense of quitting here on Earth but we'll let a few a few select folks explore yeah because that's like uh I said go for it please one of the coolest things that we humans do is kind of embodies the human Spirit reach out into the unknown but it's hard I mean as Interstellar shows and so on it's uh yeah as well Elon talks about it it's not going to be a weekend Daisy trip and he's just speculating how hard it could be much harder in different ways that he doesn't understand yet you know yeah well that you know that dance between the impossible and the inevitable that's definitely there with uh what SpaceX is doing with all the folks who are trying to become a multiplayer species are doing it's really hard it's like build rockets that fight off gravity at a cost-effective way is really hard SpaceX is close to being bankrupt several times it's just hard but it's also inspiring to that some people are just crazy enough bold enough to keep trying yeah what advice would you give to Young Folks what advice would I give in high school and college that are um thinking of how to make a their way in this world if you haven't already can you can you define what you have an innate ability for and match that with what you're willing to hustle to get sometimes foreign we have an innate ability but we don't want to work for it we take it for granted and we end up doing something that may work I pay the bills make it a spy day to day but we don't really like it we have trouble finding a way to enjoy it definitely don't love it and then sometimes we don't know what our innate ability is and we're hustling and working our tail off and breaking a sweat to do something that we really aren't that good at on an n a level and that's a good challenge and you can work and become good at something that you don't have an innate ability for but if you can match those two what do you have an innate ability because we have an innate ability to do when we do that well we do kind of enjoy it yeah and one of the things that requires is to kind of be really honest with yourself at what your innate ability is because oftentimes there's a lot of noise when you're growing up people telling you what you're good at not good at like really you have to look at yourself listen to yourself that inner like a deep rigorous self-analysis of what am I actually good at not what I hope to be good at but what I'm actually good at right and then if you look at that and you can define those two hopefully there's you can you can activate it in a way where there's a demand for what you supply you fall in love with Camila Elvis McConaughey uh what advice would you give to people on how to do just that how to find love that's a wonderful subject's been discussed since the beginning of time hadn't it love it um so I can tell you what things I've kind of learned and I'm still learning you know loves one of those mystical successes it doesn't make sense it foreign you know when I was when I was before I met Camilla I had I was coming onto my late 30s as much as I'm not a person that is Guided by timelines I was my life had not really added up to what I thought it was gonna be relationship wise I thought about that time I would have met the woman I loved married and started family and that hadn't happened and I did find myself doing that thing I was doing at the Amazon looking around the corner any perspective possible female I met that I was attracted to I was like maybe it's the one I make the joke but it's true because I get every red light I'm like checking out who's next me in the produce section at the supermarket on My Chosen produce section you know it's like looking yeah when you're in that zone you can also be a little intrusive you can trespass on people's you can get outside of yourself you can be overly impressed and not as involved and have your own Constitution and sit back and therefore if you're outside of yourself you're less attractive to your possible mate I've got a series of dreams that I've written about but I had one then that was very spiritual that was me as a radio your 88 year old Bachelor who never got married and it was a beautiful dream we're on paper I thought that should be a nightmare it wasn't what that dream did for him he was allowed me to go you may not find the woman for you and get married not a life with her that may not be and for the first time in life I was okay with that hmm not more than intellectually spiritually I was grounded I was like okay then I'm moving through the world and on this particular night as myself not intruding I was inviting I did see her move across the room and did not say who is that I said what is that and then did move to collar across the room so I did invite but I was not outside of myself and I was able to be myself with her what my eyes saw everything that she turned out to be when the lens got zoomed in more details got known and we began to talk and got more intimate and closer together and spend more time became true and then some but not every single thing that I imagined when I saw her move across the room turned out to be true and then so in the just the image um we found a had a moral similar moral bottom line about life each other how we treat ourselves what we respect what our own constitutions were we had similar uh perspectives on raising children which is very important to me and her and then we just in Jody says company yeah and we laughed together and we support each other we promoted more of each other and we lit each other's fire and we if one was rolling we kept addition you go go again take the next shot more more more this was a biggie too getting excited for each other's success yes yes to be able I think it's very important we all have jealousy I get it but it's very important to be able if you can be happy for your lover when they succeed or are succeeding or are across the room of the party Laughing With The Stranger to be happy for them when it has nothing to do with you she was I would be away she would the questions and the talks we would have she was happy for me about how excited I was about my day and my date had nothing to do with her yeah she wasn't there and I found myself not telling myself to be happy for her but being really really happy for her when she would tell me about something that happened that day with her and as much as I went through my head oh I'd have been great if I would have been there I was like not only trespass on that that you had that yeah independent of me Bravo that that's a choice you make not to not to give any time to the jealousy to the very natural jealousy that we humans have it sure doesn't happening I don't see the residuals in it true I've got it I've had it and I have it I just don't you know I haven't seen where it has any Payback I gotta ask you the biggest possible question uh what's the meaning of this whole thing oh what's the meaning of life right Matthew McConaughey why why are we here I don't know why we're here I prescribe to in a religious sense the restoration order they're here to restore order and religious sense I really I purchased that and loved that incentive and love that that view but I don't really know why we're here but I do know to go back to the front we are here that part's inevitable so now let's flip the script and go to the why not just keep living what what are we doing the base of everything Eric and we can argue it off at the base of it I can get all I can come up with is what just keep living man I mean what else are we supposed to do when we don't have any idea what to do whom we know exactly what we want to do make it matter even when it doesn't matter that matters not for what I don't know for the fun of it that matters yeah our ability to create meaning and Beauty in the mundane in the Absurd it's kind of cool yeah yeah and then we share with each other yeah or get excited yeah and we create some pretty cool stuff along the way I mean I I say I'm confident enough that I might be arrogant of me to say but I I I I do believe that we're here to each generation have a small Ascension yeah or else what's it for and we're not really sure what the Ascension is towards just kind of no it's just I think good job I do things to stop I do think that it is definitely arrogant to think that we as a species or generation or people or Humanity are going to reach the top of the ascended staircase and go tada I think that's a I think that is not only false but I think it's full-hearted and I think it's his recipe for being having more angst and and even cynicism we talked about and unrest and lack of seeing Beauty and joy in this life while we're in it um I think Life's a verb live it as best we can hopefully I mean I don't know sometimes I'm just I don't have a grand plan man I'm just trying to connect the damn Dot I'm confused frustrated I don't know what I don't feel any gravity or building or lineage towards what I'm doing and I'm just like going what's that Peterson line if we don't believe in heaven do it you do what you can to get as far away from hell as possible sometimes it's a great line sometimes I'm just trying to like man just don't don't sink the ship right now just keep your head above water maintain just try and hold on and uh hopefully give yourself a chance to notice the magic the mystical I try to do that yeah when it gets rough because it's there I do believe it's all around us all the time yeah yeah just are we on our frequency and do we allow ourselves to receive it and see it we gotta tune the radio yeah because we look for it too hard we see false idols and if we don't look at all we come callous and
